📋 **React Form App**  
React Form App is a modern, responsive React-based web application that showcases a dynamic multi-field form with real-time state updates and intuitive input handling. Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, it demonstrates controlled components, a single input handler, and custom styling — all without any external CSS framework.
